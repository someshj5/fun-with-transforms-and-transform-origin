# Fun with transforms and transform-origin
Files that go along with my YT video taking a look at transform and transform-origin

## Follow along
If you want to follow along with my tutorial or try things out on your own before watching, you can switch the linked CSS file to `start-here.css` and you'll be good to go.

## Using gulp
Included is a gulpfile which includes browserSync and a Sass compiler. If you'd like to use it, you must first have node and npm installed. Go to [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and install it, then follow these steps:

1) In your terminal, navigate to the project folder on your computer
2) type `npm install`
3) Once that is finished, type `gulp watch`
